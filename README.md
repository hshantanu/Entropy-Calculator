# Entropy-Calculator
Write a C/C++ program to crawl a directory in a Windows system, the default being the WINDOWS\System32 directory. The directory to scan is an optional command-line argument. Examine the different executable files present, namely with suffixes .exe and .dll. Ignore subdirectories and files without the exe or dll suffixes. How many files of each type are present? What is the average entropy over both types of executable files? Print a list of the files that are in the top 10% of the entropy values. For this purpose, keep track of the minimum and maximum entropy values, and print the names of files with entropy in the top 10% of the range (maximum-minimum). Refer to the Lyda paper for the entropy equation.
